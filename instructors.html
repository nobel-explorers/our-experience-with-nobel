    <p style="color:#50A6C2	">Hi, I'm Nadja. I'm a Talent Experience Lead & a Coach Community Manager here at Nobel, which pretty much means I try to take the best care possible of all the people working with Nobel. I help teams select the best talent possible, support all our contractors in their work, and communicate the needs of our coaches to the team & vice versa. I'm really passionate about education, and I believe there's nothing you can't learn as long as you keep trying hard, are consistent and aren't afraid to ask for feedback and make mistakes. Previous to working with Nobel, I studied The Spanish Language & Literature, and International Relations, volunteered a lot, and tried to learn as much as possible about work. Eventually, this lead me to Nobel, where I discovered my true passion - which is Talent Experience & helping people grow. </p>
