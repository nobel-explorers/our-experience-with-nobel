                    <h4>Vishu</h4>
                    <p>I really like how Nobel is so different from every other internship I have looked into. Specifically, it has taught me a lot that I can apply to the real world such as how to effictively communicate with people online such as through video calls! </p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Arthur</h4>
                  <p>At Nobel, I learned how to work as a team and collaborate effectively, which are important skills needed to accomplish any complex project. I also learned to make the most out of my time, implementing the scrum-agile rule in creating code and the 80/20 rule in yielding the most results in a short period of time.</p>

                  <h4>Dave</h4>
                  <p>Nobel was a great opportinity for me because I really learned a lot myself
and how to interact with other people. The people at nobel really teach
you how to work in a group well, and effectively communicate with other
people and work towards a goal. On top of that, the Nobel team is extremely patient, understanding, flexible, and helpful, and for that I am greatful.</p>

                  <h4>Vincent </h4>
                  <p>Usually, I would have to give up one or two of my Summer activities
in order to keep a good schedule. Through Nobel, I am able to
spend most of my day playing my instrument, while having time to keep
up to the others interns!</div>

<div id="block1" class="col-md-6 col-sm-12"> <!-- Removed container class -->
    <h4>Michael </h4>
    <p>I love how Nobel encourages making mistakes and failing instead of
penalizing it, because that is how people really learn to improve. I learned
a lot more about scripting, networking and web design, as well as how
important soft skills are during meetings.</div>

    <h4>Aditya </h4>
    <p>Nobel is a great place to have your first internship, and this is for many reasons. One being how we all comunicate, we use online meeting for everything workbased. This internship allowes you to not only learn the hard skills on what you should know, but also how you can work with other people in an office enviorment. My experience with nobel has been tremendous, I have learnd so many skills in such a short time.</div>

              <h4>Ben </h4>
              <p>Working on this project has allowed me to develop teamwork skills that I wouldn't have gotten to otherwise. Learning and improving as a team has been an awsome experience, and in the future I hope now young learners get a similar experience.</div>

                  <h4>Dylan</h4>
                  <p>Nobel is a very unique and different internship. During my time in Nobel I was able to learn very important softskills that help my teamates and I complete many of the projects and tasks. Also Nobel is all online which makes it easier to communicate with my teammates through video calls.</p>

                  <h4>Carolyn </h4>
                  <p>Being an intern here at Nobel has been a great experience in learning important communication skills as well as hard skills. There's a strong sense of teamwork among everyone, and respect as well. There's such a strong focus on learning things that you need to be a normally functioning adult, which school doesn't provide.</div>

                        <h4>Nashita </h4>
                        <p>Although group projects are the sole source of dread for many students, my internship at Nobel has shown me what teamwork really looks like. I have learned effective communication along with other soft skills which have allowed me to become a contributing member of a group.  </div>

                  <h4>Samirah</h4>
                  <p>Nobel provides a unique learning environment, and the projects encourage creativity and cooperation. Additionally, effective communication and teamwork are skills needed for success in college and work. Nobel allowed us to learn and apply these skills in our day to day tasks, which made it a special experience.</p>

               <h4>Shreeya</h4>
               <p>Being an intern at Nobel has helped me gain so much, from soft skills to hard skills, Nobel guides you through the process of it all. Everything is online and flexible so you don't have to give up any of your other activities to join. You get to recognize the importance of working in a team, develop projects and have the opportunity to work on so many other things that you normally wouldn't be able to do. Not the mention the Instructors are great! They let you take the lead where needed and back away to let you explore and create what you want.
