                <p>In addition to all the soft skills that the team has learned, there were important hard skills the students have mastered during the courses as well. These skills have helped the students excel in their courses as well as help them apply what they have learned to the real world
                </p>

                <p><b>Website Design</b> - In both the Coding and Web Design mini course and full course, there was a strong emphasis on the design aspect of a website. In order to understand more about it, we used a variety of resources such as WordPress which helped us create a website without any coding. Then, we learned to use wireframes which are a big part of creating a website. It helps the developers understand how the website should be laid out and coded. After that, we downloaded GIMP, a design software that helps create mockups for the website.

                <p><b>Website Coding</b> - Like above, we learned how to code websites in both the Coding and Web Design classes. Most of the team was new to HTML and CSS so we thought that it would be hard to learn more about it. However, we split up into designers and developers for the website and the developers learned more about the two coding languages and made presentations to help the rest of us to learn HTML and CSS. Not only are these skills helpful for the course we took at Nobel, but also for tasks in our daily life such as classes at school and if we come across a situation where we are tasked with creating a website for a future company.

                <p><b>Technology</b> - It isn't what you guys are thinking, it wasn't just about phones and computers, it was more than that. We learned how our devices are connected to the Internet and the inside grasp of routers and networks. This helped us understand what the problems are when we are not able to connect to the Internet or if our Wi-Fi is running slow. Furthermore, we leaned about Ping and how it is helpful for knowing how fast our Internet is before getting on a call, so that we know if we need to check something out. Lastly, we got an understanding of how it is important to use headsets because being on an online environment, it is difficult to hear and be heard by everyone in a clean manner. There may be background noises and other issues during a call, so to prevent those, we learned to use USB headsets. These are just a few things we have been taught throughout our experience with Nobel, and if you are interested in these then you should apply to become an intern!
