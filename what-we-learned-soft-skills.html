                  <p><b>Teamwork</b> - Teamwork is very important for every single team to work as well as possible. Instead of competing with each other, we, interns at Nobel, work together to make tasks a lot easier and help each other out when somebody needs it. This is a skill that we donâ€™t get the chance to practice as much in schools because there is a lot of individual work. Nobel tries to break away from that system and makes everyone work together. Whether it is interns with interns, students with students, or interns with students, the working environment becomes more friendly and allows people to feel more comfortable sharing their ideas.
                  </p>

                  <p><b>Communication</b> - Communicating effectively is a very important skill to have. Miscommunication can lead to frustration, missing meetings, as well as a less productive team, which is why communication is something that Nobel really emphasizes as important. We communicate with each other for almost every task, whether it be who will be doing what work or who will be meeting with who at what time. By doing this, we split up the work among the team and we all accomplish more work than if we all worked alone.
                  </p>

                  <p><b>Responsibility</b> - It is crucial to know that you are responsible for all your actions. At Nobel, with great freedom and liberty to manage your time and effectively split up tasks, it is necessary for students to know that they have to deal with any outcomes of their work. Although you have your facilitators and fellow interns that will help you with tasks you are struggling on, in the end, it is your work and you need to realize that you are responsible for it.
